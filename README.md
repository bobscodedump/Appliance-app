# StoreStainable

Our app allows shoppers to make better-informed decisions about the electrical appliances they purchase. Unlike most shopping applications, our focus is to compare the sustainability ratings of appliances. We offer a personalised shopping

experience by allowing users to decide their priorities, which we will use to deliver recommendations accordingly.

Most shoppers today might not take into account how sustainable a product is when shopping. Our team wanted to spread awareness of an individual's carbon footprint, and a part of that consists of their electrical expenditure. 

By encouraging conscious consumption, we hope to encourage consumers to reduce their electrical consumption, leading to a shift in companies prioritizing sustainable products. 

Storestainable does not just show you the literal cost of the product, but also the cost incurred by our planet Earth.
